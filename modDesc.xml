        <en><![CDATA[Upgrade your production facilities! With this mod you will be able to increase your production speeds and storages, so you no longer need to place multiple productions.
Features :
- Production chains now have levels that you can increase.
- Upgrading a factory will cost you slightly more each level than buying a new building.
- Upgrading cost is vastly compensated by the gain in production speed.
- More production speed means more storage space.
- Because you don't have to build a new facility, you save on production costs.
- Factory value is increased when upgrading, so you can claim your investment back when selling a facility.

Note that there is no maximum level, only your money will limit you!
This mod does not yet support multiplayer.
